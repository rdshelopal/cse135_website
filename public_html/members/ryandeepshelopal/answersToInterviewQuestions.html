        <h2>Answers to Your Interview Questions</h2>

        <section class="qa-block">
            <h3>Tell me about yourself</h3>
            <p>
            I'm a recent Computer Engineering graduate from UC San Diego with a strong foundation in software development, embedded systems, and machine learning. Lately, Iâ€™ve been diving deep into front-end development, where Iâ€™ve been building responsive and intuitive web experiences using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Iâ€™m all about turning technical challenges into polished, functional solutions.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="qa-block">
            <h3>What are your strengths?</h3>
            <p>
            Iâ€™m reliable, focused, and always ready to learn. I thrive when solving problemsâ€”whether itâ€™s debugging hardware or designing a clean web layout. I value structure but can adapt quickly, especially when balancing performance with usability.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="qa-block">
            <h3>How do you handle tight deadlines or pressure?</h3>
            <p>
            I break the work down into small, clear chunks and stay organized. I prioritize communication with teammates and keep momentum up without panicking. Iâ€™ve learned how to pace myself from managing projects during busy school quarters and staying consistent with technical deep-dives.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="qa-block">
            <h3>What excites you about front-end development?</h3>
            <p>
            I love being able to directly shape the user experience. Thereâ€™s something satisfying about turning logic into designâ€”whether it's through clean HTML structure or adding that final touch of interactivity with JavaScript. Plus, it's rewarding to see your work instantly come to life in the browser.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="qa-block">
            <h3>How do you stay up to date?</h3>
            <p>
            I experiment a lotâ€”building my own projects and adjusting them as I learn. I also explore community resources, YouTube channels, and documentation. I focus on learning by doing, which keeps things hands-on and practical.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="qa-block">
            <h3>What kind of work environment do you thrive in?</h3>
            <p>
            I work best in environments that value independence, clarity, and momentum. I enjoy asynchronous communication, and Iâ€™m comfortable owning tasks and following through without micromanagement. That said, I really appreciate teammates who check in, share feedback, and collaborate with purpose.
