I made several enhancements to improve visual consistency and user experience across my site. I adjusted the light and dark mode color schemes to be easier on the eyes, making the interface more comfortable for extended viewing. I replaced the old "Settings" button in the navigation bar with a dedicated light/dark mode toggle, since that was its only functional purpose at this stage. I also added JavaScript functionality to my Home button, allowing users to return to the homepage from any page by clicking my name. Additionally, I styled the "Load Local" and "Load Remote" buttons for better visibility and usability. Finally, I fixed an issue with my "Download Resume" button that was caused by a malformed `<a>` tag. These updates collectively enhance site accessibility, navigational clarity, and polish, while setting a strong foundation for future feature additions.
